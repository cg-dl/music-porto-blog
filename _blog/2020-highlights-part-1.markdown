#### January
> _I was stuck in the middle of a flooding road. I was going to church for Holy Mass on January 1st. Then, the flooding blocked the road to the church and also to my home. It was not a good day._

It was already raining since New Year's Eve. The rain poured lightly, so I thought it was okay to go for Holy Mass the next morning. It was January 1st, the Solemnity of the Mother of God. However, sadly the road to the church and back home is blocked due to flooding. I was forced to leave my vehicle there and come back later to fetch it after the flooding recedes. The new clothes I wore that day, submerged in flood. It was a painful and exhausting day.

#### February
> _February is the most ordinary out of all months this year. That month I was still going to campus for lectures._

It was an ordinary month. I still went for lectures, choir rehearsals, and helped my university organize Holy Mass necessities. That month, I was organizing Holy Mass for Ash Wednesday. It is the only big event that happened that month.

#### March
> _That month, I was going to a church for a Holy Mass on Solemnity of Saint Joseph. It was the last time I was going to church for a proper Mass this year._

I did not go to the campus anymore from that month. Few days after that, I went to church for Holy Mass. Unbeknownst to me, it is the last time I go to church for a proper Holy Mass. Since that day, all Masses are redirected to live stream and there is a reduction in the liturgy.

#### April
> _My friends and I formed a vocal group focusing on singing Church music. This video is our first performance online._
