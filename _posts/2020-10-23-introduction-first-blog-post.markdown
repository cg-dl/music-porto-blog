Hello, my name is Davin, an amateur composer of Classical and Sacred music and also the owner and the creator of this website. I'm from Indonesia.

Currently, I'm attending a university in Jakarta, majoring in Computer Science. Yeah, I'm not a music student from any music education institution. I learned everything about music by myself, at least until now. Now, I'm a member of the said university choir, so now I could learn something from my music director.

This website is a medium for me to combine my passion for music and my liking for computer science. This website shows all my music works and allows everyone to download my music (sheet music) and also serves as a portfolio for my computer science career since I made this website from scratch.

Recently, I built this blog using Jekyll (a site generator written in Ruby). Although this blog is still not perfect, I hope this blog could serve as a medium for you to know me better.
