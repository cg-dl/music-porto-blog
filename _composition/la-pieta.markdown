This is a simple violin and harpsichord duet piece depicting the sorrow of a mother who lost her only son, the sorrow of Mother Mary. The piece uses baroque tuning (A=415Hz) as its tuning.

This composition is accessible by intermediate violinist and pianist/harpsichordist. This piece is also playable in standard tuning and when harpsichord is substituted by a piano.
