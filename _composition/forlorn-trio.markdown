This is a simple piano trio (violin, violoncello, and piano) piece depicting the loneliness and hopelessness of an abandoned person. When the dynamics becoming more forte, there is a yearning of something said person could not even reach, succeeded by another moment of lamenting.

This composition is accessible and suitable for early intermediate violin, cello, piano students. The critical point of this piece is the expression, dynamics, and ability to play through phrases seamlessly.
